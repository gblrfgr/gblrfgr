# ‚å®Ô∏è Hello there!

### üïπ My name is Juniper Mills. I'm a computer engineering student (class of 2026) who works with a lot of embedded software, mathematical modeling, and control theory. I am currently seeking an internship for summer 2025.

### ‚öôÔ∏è My r√©sum√© is available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TvqAFp7FYPDUlZ_qYlwOEsggogC9-5vG/view?usp=sharing). I've worked on a wide variety of projects, including simulations, embedded development, and mobile robotics.

### ‚ùå My X/Twitter is available [here](https://www.x.com/gblrfgr).

### üß™ In addition to the work featured here, I have developed PMSM (permanent magnet synchronous motor) simulations at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1es1HUDHOTxinYnfmK975Zp2LojIHBcfX?usp=sharing) and performed significant work that is under NDAs and thus cannot be shared.
